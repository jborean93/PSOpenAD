# Changelog for PSOpenAD

## v0.4.0 - 2023-09-05

+ Moved module code into a separate Assembly Load Context to avoid assembly conflicts for dependencies
+ Added the following cmdlets:
  + [New-OpenADObject](./docs/en-US/New-OpenADObject.md): Creates new AD objects
  + [Remove-OpenADObject](./docs/en-US/Remove-OpenADObject.md): Removes AD objects
  + [Get-OpenADRootDSE](./docs/en-US/Get-OpenADRootDSE.md): Get the root directory server information tree
+ Fixed up `-LDAPFilter` logic to align the `\` escaping behaviour with OpenLDAP and the `Get-AD*` cmdlets
  + Before a filter with the char `\` had to have 2 more chars `[A-F0-9]` which represented the characters hex value
  + Now if the `\` does not have 2 characters after or they don't match the hex pattern, the `\` and subsequent values are treated literally
+ Fixed up some binary length calculations for the `PSOpenAD.Security` classes

## v0.3.0 - 2023-05-02

+ Bumped minimum PowerShell version to 7.2
+ Added `Get-OpenADPrincipalGroupMembership` that returns the groups a principal is a member of - thanks @theaquamarine in https://github.com/jborean93/PSOpenAD/pull/61
+ Added SecurityIdentifier properties, methods, and operators by @theaquamarine in https://github.com/jborean93/PSOpenAD/pull/62
+ Catch errors from ResolveService() when importing by @theaquamarine in https://github.com/jborean93/PSOpenAD/pull/59

## v0.2.0 - 2022-11-04

+ Added `Get-OpenADGroupMember` that returns members of a group - thanks @theaquamarine

## v0.1.1 - 2022-07-28

+ Fix up case insensitive matching for requested LDAP attributes/properties.

## v0.1.0 - 2022-07-09

+ Fix up `Get-OpenAD*` calls where there is no valid metadata to calculate the valid properties.
+ Minor tweaks to error messages when using an un-authenticated bind.

## v0.1.0-preview5 - 2022-06-27

+ Fix up edge case for calculating input LDAP message lengths causing an unpack exception
+ Make the AD object properties in a `Get-*` operation return with the first character in upper case to fit the PowerShell standard
+ Validate the requested `-Properties` on `Get-OpenAD*` cmdlets are valid for the object class that is being queried
  + Invalid properties/attributes will result in a pipeling terminating error
+ Various fixes to the tab completion of `-Properties` on `Get-OpenAD*`
  + The order will now be in alphabetical order
  + Include attributes that are defined on auxiliary types as well as sub types
+ Ensures that the `-Properties` selected on `Get-OpenAD*` will exist in the output object
  + If a property was requested but not set on the LDAP object, the property will now be set to `$null` rather than be missing
  + This is a change from the Microsoft `ActiveDirectory` module which omits the properties entirely if the attribute did not have a value
+ Ensure connections that have timed out are not reused causing a deadlock
+ Ensure `Get-OpenADUser` also filtered by `(objectClass=user)` to avoid pulling in contacts

## v0.1.0-preview4 - 2022-06-15

+ Added error handling for search request that ends with a referral
  + Currently the cmdlet will emit an error record with the referral URI which is similar to what the AD cmdlets do
+ Have exceptions in the background recv thread tasks bubble up as inner exceptions to preserve the stack trace for better debugging
+ Fix authentication with explicit credential on Windows
+ Added `-TracePath` to `New-OpenADSessionOption` to help debug raw LDAP traffice exchanged in a session.
+ Fix credential prompt when specifying `-Credential my-username` for a `PSCredential` parameter
+ Have `Get-OpenADWhoami` return an object with more details on the LDAP session, like the domain controller DNS name, URI, and authentication method used.
  + The returned username value will also strip the leading `u:` prefix if it is present
+ Added the `DomainController` property to the `OpenADSession` class to help identify the domain controller the session is connected to
+ Fixed the default parameter sets of the `Get-OpenAD*` cmdlets to always use the default LDAP filter that selects all of that type unless an explicit filter or identity was provided
+ Added `-ClientCertificate` to `New-OpenADSessionOption` that is used to authenticate using a client X.509 certificate
+ Raise `UnpackLDAPMessageException` when failing to unpack a response from the server.
  + The exception contains the `LDAPMessage` property which is the raw byte string that was being unpacked.
+ Added the `DomainController` property to the results of any `Get-OpenAD*` objects to help identify what domain controller returned that information

## v0.1.0-preview3 - 2022-03-22

+ Allow using `hostname:port` syntax when using `-Server` rather than always requiring the full LDAP URI
+ Add pagination search control to search requests to retrieve large datasets back from the domain controller
+ Fix length calculation bug when parsing an LDAP control on a returned response

## v0.1.0-preview2 - 2022-02-22

+ Improve GSSAPI and Kebreros library loading
+ Added error messages to describe why PSOpenAD failed to find the implicit DC host
+ Change `-UseSSL` to `-UseTLS`
+ Always add `$` to the `-Identity` of `Get-OpenADComputer` and `Get-OpenADServiceAccount` when using a `sAMAccountName`
+ Fix piping of multiple `-Identity` values into the `Get-OpenAD*` cmdlets

## v0.1.0-preview1 - 2022-02-1

+ Initial version of the `PSOpenAD` module
